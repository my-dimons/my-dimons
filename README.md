# 🎮 Game Development
I'm a young programmer who got interested in **Unity** when I was ~12. View my Unity games on my [itch.io](https://mydimons.itch.io/), and watch videos I make on my games on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@mydimons_). I also know a bit of [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/), but I haven't used it recently.

# 🤖 Robotics
I do some [FIRST robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/frc/) programming on the [Esquimalt Atom Smashers (7287/20025)](https://github.com/Esquimalt-Atom-Smashers). I am mainly focusing on FRC in 2025/2026, but do a little bit of FTC on the side.
